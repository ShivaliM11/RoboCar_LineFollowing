/*
 * What is the following interface?
 * Normally, I prefer inter-thread communication to come in one of two forms:
 * [1] a "flag" where no history is maintained, every write stomps on whatever was there
 * [2] a "queue" where all history is maintained, there is a backlog of previous writes to be read
 *
 * The following structure is somewhat similar to the queue option in that there is some history.
 * In this case, a reader active in the communication channel switches the mode of operation of the interface to that of a flag; the writer stomps on the data not being read.
 * When no reader is in the channel, a writer will ping-pong between the two bitmaps.
 * The reader only ever cares about the most recent bitmap.
 * The writer tries to update the oldest bitmap. Sometimes, the writer does not have that opportunity because the reader is using the oldest bitmap.
 *
 * Note:
 * If the GUI thread cannot display fast enough to keep up with the timer, the display will not update.
 * Neither the GUI thread nor the main thread will block, but the display will not make progress.
